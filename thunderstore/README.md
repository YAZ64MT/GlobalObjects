# Global Objects for Majora's Mask: Recompiled

This is a mod for Majora's Mask: Recompiled that is a dependency for mods that need static references to vanilla objects.

This can be used to draw objects in places that they are not normally loaded.

The header for this mod can be found [here](https://github.com/Neirn/Z64Recomp_GlobalObjects/blob/main/include/globalobjects_api.h).

API is currently unstable and may change between updates.
